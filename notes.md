# 44 Dynamics
### U+E521 dynamicMezzo
The original uses a much thinner ‘m’ for the mezzo-forte markings. The version here is boldened in order to match with the set. The original thin m can be found at **U+E42D dynamicMF**
### U+E52D dynamicMF
The forte marking used when showing mf is different to **U+E252 dynamicForte**: it descends lower and further under the m. The m is also different (see **U+E521 dynamicMezzo**). Both of these qualities are retained at this combined character codepoint.
